There are different types of performance testing to measure various risks:

   * **Ping tests** measure variability in reaching the server so that spikes in network or server availability will not confound performance test results.
   
   * **Speed tests** involve single users to identify response times from a range of app functionality.
   
   * **Concurrency tests** identify the impact of multiple requests for the same resources at the same time.
   
   * **Load tests** stop testing at a targeted load level (for certification).
   
   * **Stress tests** increase users (load) to identify the **bottleneck** limiting further capacity.
   
   * **Scalability tests** measure how much capacity really improves when additional/less hardware is added/removed.
   
   * **Endurance tests** measure gradual useage of resources (memory, disk space, etc.) over a longer run times.
   
   * **Baseline tests** establish a set of metrics for (all) the tests above 
     as the basis for comparison when configurations are changed and another set of tests are run.
