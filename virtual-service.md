What I'm proposing is an open-source extension of the Wiremock Java program to emulate web service APIs.

0. Know the features (why):

  * Stateful behaviour simulation
  
  * Configurable response delays

0. Read the latest posts at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wiremock-user

0. May need to have a proxy to act like the API.

0. Download the stand-alone jar from http://wiremock.org/running-standalone.html

  NOTE: This is based on code at https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock
  which configures Gradle, Travis, etc.
