### Sample Application Under Test (AUT)</a>
The ideal sample app would these characteristics:

   0. Be built on code which provides responsive web, native mobile (iOS and Android), plus APIs.
   0. Be built on code which is open sourced (e.g., available on github).
   0. Be built on code which makes use of open sourced libraries and tools (java).
   0. Be built on code accompanied by tutorials on its construction.
   0. Be built on code which contain coding that returns errors when optionally switched on (for validating test code).
   0. Be built with code which exihibits various approaches (pooling, multi-threading) so that performance can be compared.

Apps currently used for tutorials, benchmarking, and pre-sales do not meet all the criteria above.

   * WebTours used in most JMeter tutorials to date (within commerical performance testing software LoadRunner)
     returns errors based on a switch, but its source is not available to the public.
