AWS Cloud Formation manages infrastructure.

Pulp is a centralized repository to manage Puppet revisions.

Puppet manifests, hierdata, and modules distributed to all machines via RPM.

Machines boot with a common, blank image and get configured at first boot
rather than different images with software already installed.
