Data for testing:

  * Application master data such as list of accounts which new transactions reference.
  * Application transaction input data such as input by users and customers during registration.

Sham, at <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/tomdcc/sham">http://github.com/tomdcc/sham</a>,
generates test data for Java and JVM-based projects
for serendipitous bug discovery during exploratory testing.

It's by Tom Dunstan, who works on Grails.
Thus, sham's docs are not viewabled until generated by grails after download/clone.
