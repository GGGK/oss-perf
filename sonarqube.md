SonarQube (abbreviated to Sonar here)
improves code quality by scanning source code
to identify **issues** from **meaures** it calculates.

Sonar analyzes various languages 
using plug-ins.

A summary of what it finds estimates <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Technical+Debt">
Technical Debt</a>, 
which SonarQube tracks over time.

Sonar scans different **facets** (such as security).

## SQALE Summary Ratings
Sonar calculates a **SQALE Rating** based on the open-source
SQALE (Software Quality Assessment based on Lifecycle Expectations) methodology defined by industry group 
http://www.sqale.org/. The caluculation is based on inclusion of rules set in the Common SonarQube repository:

 * Duplicated blocks
 * Failed unit tests
 * Insufficient branch coverage by unit tests
 * Insufficient comment density
 * Insufficient line coverage by unit tests
 * Skipped unit tests

Most developers prefer to have Sonar look at code before commit into a team repository.
Such **preview mode** runs do not store results in the Sonar run database.

Plugins enable Sonar to be invoked several ways:

  * <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.sonarqube.org/x/3AAW">From a command line</a> as one step in local evaluations.
    This approach enables one-time <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analysis+Parameters">parameter configuration</a> 
    for each individual user.

    ```
    sonar-runner
    ```

  * From inside IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.) as part of code unit development and testing.

  * From a build server (Maven, Ant, MSBuild, etc.) as part of continuous integration/build.

The server uses Oracle or <a target="_blank" href="http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html">OpenSDK</a>,
which requires much more work 
https://github.com/hgomez/obuildfactory/wiki/Building-and-Packaging-OpenJDK7-for-OSX
So please stay with Oracle for now.

MySQL is supported.

Docker and Puppet scripts to build the server ???
