Wiremock is an open-source library for stubbing and proxying web services 
to replace dependency servers.

<a target="_blank" href="http://wiremock.org/"> http://wiremock.org</a>
is a flexible Java-language library for stubbing and mocking web services. 
Unlike general purpose mocking tools it works by creating an actual HTTP server that your code under test can connect to as it would a real web service.

It supports HTTP response stubbing, request verification, proxy/intercept, record/playback of stubs and fault injection, and can be used from within a unit test or deployed into a test environment.

Although it’s written in Java, there’s also a JSON API so you can use it with pretty much any language out there.

  * Stubbing returns canned resources (request A always returns reponse B).
  * Fault injection (returns error or blanks) for resiliancy testing.
  * Easy setup
  * Easy on-boarding
