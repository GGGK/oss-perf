This page provides background informaiton on Tableau software.

Tableau is a complete Data Analytics platform enabling everyone to gain
insights from raw data. It makes working with data universally accessible.

Tableau clients running on Windows and Macs are used to create ".viz" files which define visualization display settings.

## Tableau Public</a>

Tableau Public is meant for individuals to show off visualizations of public data sets
(and blogging about them) in Tableau's social sharing site
https://public.tableau.com/ 
This is much like what Adobe offers.

"VIZ of the day" from the Tableau Public sharing website is highlighted on the landing page of Tableau Desktop.

https://public.tableau.com/s/resources
announce monthly webinars and provides free on-line training videos also published under
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfAoXs9ej01qqIj6ti456tg/videos">
Tableau Smith on YouTube</a>, which has more videos than on the website.

QUESTION: How about videos instead of text blogs? That would enable us to describe changes over time.

Vizzes by bloggers can be published on other sites, such as:
