## Tableau Public</a>

Tableau Public is meant for individuals to show off visualizations of public data sets
(and blogging about them) in Tableau's social sharing site
https://public.tableau.com/ 
This is much like what Adobe offers.

"VIZ of the day" from the Tableau Public sharing website is highlighted on the landing page of Tableau Desktop.

https://public.tableau.com/s/resources
announce monthly webinars and provides free on-line training videos also published under
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfAoXs9ej01qqIj6ti456tg/videos">
Tableau Smith on YouTube</a>, which has more videos than on the website.

QUESTION: How about videos instead of text blogs? That would enable us to describe changes over time.

Vizzes by bloggers can be published on other sites, such as:

Tableau provides a rich variety of chart types.

Tableau recommends a chart type based on the data set loaded when "Show Me" is clicked.

The value of various types are described in the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_9nMSvY1FE

What's most amazing, Tableau enables users to create charts just by dragging and dropping.
