## What is Swagger?</a>

Swagger Core stores JAX-RS API designs in JSON files from which
Swagger UI dynamically generates beautiful HTML documentation.

Swagger's objective is to be a complete framework for 
describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services
for developers to fully program clients calling them.

Thus, Swagger CodeGen generates in client code for different languages.


<a id="Who">
### Who built Swagger?</a>

Swagger originated from folks at Wordnik (the on-line English dictionary).

The testing company SmartBear now manages the <a target="_blank" href="http://swagger.io/">
swagger.io</a> website
and https://swaggerhub.com/ provides an instance of swagger on a free platform for teams to collaborate on and coordinate across the entire workflow of an API’s lifecycle. SwaggerHub leverages a centralized definition to allow the whole team to work together to iteratively design, build, document and manage an API.

SwaggerHub includes connectors for GitHub, DockerHub and Ready! API.
