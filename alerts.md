Watcher is a plugin for Elasticsearch that provides alerting and notification based on changes in your data.

It checks results from the query against a condition.

a 3rd party system is notified, or the query results are stored.

  * When the number of tweets and posts in an area exceeds a threshold of significance, notify a service technician.

  * Track application response times and if page-load time exceeds SLAs for more than 5 minutes, open a helpdesk ticket. If SLAs are exceeded for an hour, page the administrator on duty.
