Jenkins is open-source Java software (running under a Tomcat web server)
to invoke jobs on a schedule ("continuosly")
such as for building software and conducting tests.

Jenkins is a key component of <strong>continuous integration</strong> 
to invoke a chain of tasks needed to ensure that components already unit-tested can be integrated together.
See <a target="_blank" href="http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=continuous- integration">
Pluralsight course by James Kovacs</a>

PROTIP: Experienced people warn to NOT check in code that may break things (fails even local unit testing).
This is achieved by having each developer having full capabilities on their workstations or in a private cloud stack.
This may mean using mock interfaces.

## Alternatives to Jenkins</a>
<img align="right" alt="jenkins alternatives" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12533728/df265ae4-c1ee-11e5-9a0b-bbc380a2d20f.png">

Jenkins began in 2010 as a fork of Hudson into Github from java.net after its acquisition by Oracle's purchase of Sun.

<a id="Install">
## Installation</a>
Installation is not necessary if you use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cloudbees.com/">
Cloudbees.com</a> which hosts Jenkins in their cloud.

Alternately, many host Jenkins on the Amazon cloud:

### Installation on Linux</a>
Alternately, to install on RedHat and Centos Linux machines, follow instructions at:

 * https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Red+Hat+distributions

<a id="Install_Mac">
### Installation on Macs</a>
Alternately, install on Mac OSX using Homebrew:

 ```
 brew update
 brew doctor
 brew install jenkins
 ```

  A sample response:

  ```

Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully
The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local
Could not symlink bin/jenkins
/usr/local/bin is not writable.

You can try again using:
  brew link jenkins
==> Caveats
Note: When using launchctl the port will be 8080.

To have launchd start jenkins at login:
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/jenkins/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load jenkins now:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.jenkins.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  jenkins

<a id="Install_Windows">
### Installation on Windows</a>
0. Open a Command Window.
0. Install the Chocolatey package manager (if you haven't already) by copying and pasting the PowerShell command from
   <a target="_blank" href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey.org</a>
0. Install the version of Jenkins that Chocolatey makes available:
 
  ```
 choco install jenkins
  ```
 
   If Java is not installed on your computer already, it will be installed as a dependency.

  ```
???
 ```

0. Verify install by <a href="#Start-server">starting Jenkins server</a>.


<a id="Verify_install">
### Verify Installation on Macs and Linux</a>

0. Verify intallation on a Mac or Linux:

 ```
 which jenkins
 ```
 
 The response is the location it was installed:
 
 ```
 /usr/local/bin/jenkins
 ```

<a id="Start-server">
## Start and stop server</a>
The command to start Jenkins has several parameters:
 
 * https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Starting+and+Accessing+Jenkins

0. Start Jenkins using defaults:

 ```
 jenkins
 ```

0. Stop the server by closing the command window which it runs under.

0. Start Jenkins again using more parameters as described in:

 ```
 java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8081
 ```

  Alternately, start Jenkins to a specific port for HTTPS:

 ```
 java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=-1 --httpPort=221
 ```

0. Confirm tcp ports Jenkins uses as java (8005 sharing, 8009, 8080) 

  ```
  netstat -anp | grep java
  ```


<a id="Config_Security">
## Configure User Security</a>
Jenkins installation options are described at:
 
 * https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Starting+and+Accessing+Jenkins

 By default, Jenkins stores its configuration files in the user's home folder at `~/.jenkins`.

 To make a Jenkins server completely public (and open to hacking)
 use a text editor to edit ~jenkins/.ssh/config
 to add `StrictHostKeyChecking no`.

0. Create a key without a passphrase, per https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

0. Login under user named Jenkins (if applicable):

 ```
 sudo su jenkins
 ```

0. Copy your github key to Jenkins .ssh folder.

 ```
 cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github*  /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
 ```

0. Raname the keys:

 ```
 mv id_rsa_github id_rsa
 mv id_rsa_github.pub id_rsa.pub
 ```



<a id="AddUser">
## Add User Permissions</a>
<img align="right" width="181" alt="jenkins full menu" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12525765/b4483cbc-c11b-11e5-8053-57556314ff0e.png">
If you don't see the full menu shown on the right, you don't have some permissions.

As with other systems, granting permissions is typically done only by the Administrator of the system.

0. In **Manage Jenkins** UI enter **Configre Global Security**.
0. Check Enable Security.
0. If you have an LDAP, select that, or check Use Jenkin's own user database. But you'll have to add each user.
0. Check **Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy** to limit Anonymous users Read-only access.

   PROTIP: Rather than specifying individual users and their permissions,
   the preferred approach is to firt assign individual users to a group in LDAP,
   then assign permission to the group.

0. For an existing user/group, check boxes to its right.

   <img width="710" alt="jenkins-security-permissions-matrix" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/11181173/6ea5dfe4-8c1d-11e5-9674-ef0e7d88ef8d.png">

0. Or create a user.


<a id="Nodes">
## Nodes</a>
 A Jenkins server can scale by adding **nodes** to spread build work across several servers running different operating systems.

 Look at the **Load Statistics** UI to see whether additional nodes are necessary.
 
 Jenkins slave nodes can be started by the master using several launch methods:

  * Launch slave agents on Unix machines via SSH
  * Launch slave agents via Java Web Start
  * Launch slave via execution of command on the Master
  * Let Jenkins control this Window slave as a Windows service

0. Setup a node as a VirtualBox. TODO.

0. In Configure Server, a node can be setup as a **Virtualbox** 
   URL such as http://localhost:18083/.

0. In Manage Nodes, configure a VBox host.
1. Run the box by clicking the icon at the far right of the node listed.
2. Launch Slave Agent to start the machine.

<a id="Node_Security">
### From a slave node</a>
0. From a slave command line, connect to a Jenkins master:
 
 ```
 java -jar slave.jar -jnlpUrl http://jenkins-master:8081/computer/Test Node/slave-agent.jnlp
 ```

 Several **executors** can be running simultaneously.
 This number is specified within the **Manage Jenkins** UI.
 
 Tool locations (such as Github) is also specified in that UI.

 Nodes are described at:
 * https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds

<a id="Builds">
## Build Projects</a>
Jenkins was originally created for automating the building (compilation) of java programs.
But Jenkins is ALSO used for other types of work.
Nevertheless, the Jenkins term <strong>"build"</strong> 
is another word for what operating systems call a <strong>"job"</strong> (unit of batch work).

Builds/jobs can be automatically triggered several ways:

 * after other projects
 * periodically on a schedule
 * poll a version control system for changes


<a id="Plugins">
## Plugins</a>
0. Click **Manage Jenkins** on the left menu of the Dashboard screen.
1. Clikc **Manage Plugins**.
2. Click **Installed** tab to view what has been installed already.

   * Email Extension Plugin
   * Git Plugin
   * Graddle Plugin
   * SSH Slaves
   * Translation Assistance
   * Workspace Cleanup Plugin
   
   For Microsoft developers:

   * MSBuild
   * MSTest
   * MSTest Runner
   * VSTest Runner
0. Click **Available** tab has many plug-ins.

0. Click on a category (Artifact Uploaders) to expand additional categories.

0. View the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins">
Wiki on Plugins</a>.

 PROTIP: The wide variety of plugins is why Jenkins is popular.

The plugin: <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Remote+Trigger+Plugin">
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Remote+Trigger+Plugin</a>
**triggers** parameterized builds on other jenkins servers. 
This would centralize a single store of credentials.

 Plugins inject **Add build step** choices.

<a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extension+points">
Extension points</a> are plugins that extend other plugins.

The flow for programming code may includ **static code analysis** 
 such as using StyleCop (there is also SonarQube).
This provides options on what violations to report.
