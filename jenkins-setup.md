Jenkins is open-source Java software (running under a Tomcat web server)
to invoke jobs on a schedule ("continuosly")
such as for building software and conducting tests.

Jenkins is a key component of <strong>continuous integration</strong> 
to invoke a chain of tasks needed to ensure that components already unit-tested can be integrated together.
See <a target="_blank" href="http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=continuous- integration">
Pluralsight course by James Kovacs</a>

PROTIP: Experienced people warn to NOT check in code that may break things (fails even local unit testing).
This is achieved by having each developer having full capabilities on their workstations or in a private cloud stack.
This may mean using mock interfaces.

## Alternatives to Jenkins</a>
<img align="right" alt="jenkins alternatives" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12533728/df265ae4-c1ee-11e5-9a0b-bbc380a2d20f.png">

Jenkins began in 2010 as a fork of Hudson into Github from java.net after its acquisition by Oracle's purchase of Sun.

### Cloudbees Installation</a>
Installation is not necessary if you use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cloudbees.com/">
Cloudbees.com</a> which hosts Jenkins in their cloud. Their CEO is Kohsuke Kawaguchi (@kohsukekwa, kk@kohsuke.org)
who invented Hudson/Jenkins. Hear him speak at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nG4xGYvAa0"> this Oct, 2014 meetup about Workflow</a>.

Cloudbees sells Nectar, a supported and enhanced on-premise version of Jenkins that automatically scales on VMWare virtual machines.

Note: When using launchctl the port will be 8080.

To have launchd start jenkins at login:
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/jenkins/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load jenkins now:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.jenkins.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:

### Verify Installation on Macs and Linux</a>

0. Verify intallation on a Mac or Linux:

   ```
   which jenkins
   ```
 
   The response is the location Jenkins was installed:
 
   ```
   /usr/local/bin/jenkins
   ```

<a id="Start-server">
## Start and stop server</a>
The command to start Jenkins has several parameters.

0. See https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Starting+and+Accessing+Jenkins
   for a full explanation, inclidiong use of <strong>nohup</strong>.

0. Start Jenkins using defaults:

   ```
   jenkins
   ```


0. Confirm tcp ports Jenkins uses as java (8005 sharing, 8009, 8080):

   ```
   netstat | grep java
   ```

0. Stop the server by escaping the process.

   * Ctrl+C on Windows
   * command+C on Macs

   The response is:
   
   ```
   INFO: JVM is terminating. Shutting down Winstone
   ```

   This soft-stop enables Jenkins to save data to memory rather than potentially lose data during a hard and sudden stop by closing the command window which it runs under (by clicking the red X on that window).

   BTW, some install the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SafeRestart+Plugin"> 
SafeRestart plug-in</a>, which adds the <strong>Restart Safely</strong> option to the 
<a title="jenkins saferestart_plugin" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12584913/9681b1d2-c3fe-11e5-9359-e51fc5809734.png">
Jenkins left menu</a> to avoid needing to be at the server console at all.

0. Start Jenkins again using more parameters as described in:

   ```
   cd /usr/local/Cellar/jenkins/1.644/libexec
   java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8081
   ```

   Alternately, start Jenkins to a specific port for HTTPS:

   ```
   java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=-1 --httpPort=221
   ```
 
    PROTIP: Put one of these commands in a shell script.

<a id="Config_Security">
## Configure User Security</a>
Jenkins installation options are described at:
 
 * https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Starting+and+Accessing+Jenkins

 By default, Jenkins stores its configuration files in the user's home folder at `~/.jenkins`.

 To make a Jenkins server completely public (and open to hacking)
 use a text editor to edit ~jenkins/.ssh/config
 to add `StrictHostKeyChecking no`.

0. Create a key without a passphrase, per https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

0. Login under user named Jenkins (if applicable):

   ```
   sudo su jenkins
   ```

0. Copy your github key to Jenkins .ssh folder.

   ```
   cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github*  /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
   ```

0. Raname the keys:

   ```
   mv id_rsa_github id_rsa
   mv id_rsa_github.pub id_rsa.pub

If you don't see the full menu shown on the right, you don't have some permissions.

As with other systems, granting permissions is typically done only by the Administrator of the system.

0. In **Manage Jenkins** UI enter **Configre Global Security**.
0. Check Enable Security.
0. If you have an LDAP, select that, or check Use Jenkin's own user database. But you'll have to add each user.
0. Check **Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy** to limit Anonymous users Read-only access.

   PROTIP: Rather than specifying individual users and their permissions,
   the preferred approach is to firt assign individual users to a group in LDAP,
   then assign permission to the group.

0. For an existing user/group, check boxes to its right.

3. Select the Available tab.
4. In Filter type "Performance".
5. Check to select "Performance plugin".
6. Click "Download now and install after restart".
7. Click to restart server.

If you prefer a manual approach:

0. Create a folder to hold the folder created during cloning (such as jmeter or jenkinsci).
1. cd to that folder, then:

   ```
git clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/performance-plugin.git performance
cd performance
   ```
   
   This contains a pom.xml file for Maven to compile the src folder.
   
0. If you haven't already:

   ```
brew install maven
   ```
   
0. Compile in a command window:

   ```
mvn package
   ```

   This downloads a bunch of files specified as dependencies, ending in this:

switching report format to xml in jmeter properties file:

   ```
   jmeter.save.saveservice.output_format=xml
   ```

0. Configure the search pattern to select the files to be parsed by the Performance plugin. JMeter generates <strong>.jtl</strong> files.

0. Configure the error percentage thresholds which would make the project unstable or failed 

  
0. When no jobs are running, restart the Jenkins server to reload the plugin.

<a id="Nodes">
## Nodes for scalability</a>
 A Jenkins server can scale by adding **nodes** to spread build work across several servers running different operating systems.

 Look at the **Load Statistics** UI to see whether additional nodes are necessary.
 
 Jenkins slave nodes can be started by the master using several launch methods:

  * Launch slave agents on Unix machines via SSH
  * Launch slave agents via Java Web Start
  * Launch slave via execution of command on the Master
  * Let Jenkins control this Window slave as a Windows service

0. Setup a node as a VirtualBox. TODO.

0. In Configure Server, a node can be setup as a **Virtualbox** 
   URL such as http://localhost:18083/.

0. In Manage Nodes, configure a VBox host.
1. Run the box by clicking the icon at the far right of the node listed.
2. Launch Slave Agent to start the machine.

<a id="Node_Security">
### From a slave node</a>
0. From a slave command line, connect to a Jenkins master:
 
   ```
   java -jar slave.jar -jnlpUrl http://jenkins-master:8081/computer/Test Node/slave-agent.jnlp
   ```

 Several **executors** can be running simultaneously.
 This number is specified within the **Manage Jenkins** UI.
 
 Tool locations (such as Github) is also specified in that UI.

 Nodes are described at:
 * https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds

<a id="Builds">
## Build Projects</a>
Jenkins was originally created for automating the building (compilation) of java programs.
But Jenkins is ALSO used for other types of work.
Nevertheless, the Jenkins term <strong>"build"</strong> 
is another word for what operating systems call a <strong>"job"</strong> (unit of batch work).

Builds/jobs can be automatically triggered several ways:

 * after other projects
 * periodically on a schedule
 * poll a version control system for changes

   * Email Extension Plugin
   * Git Plugin
   * Graddle Plugin
   * SSH Slaves
   * Translation Assistance
   * Workspace Cleanup Plugin

 PROTIP: The wide variety of plugins is why Jenkins is popular.

The plugin: <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Remote+Trigger+Plugin">
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Remote+Trigger+Plugin</a>
**triggers** parameterized builds on other jenkins servers. 
This would centralize a single store of credentials.

 Plugins inject **Add build step** choices.

<a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extension+points">
Extension points</a> are plugins that extend other plugins.

The flow for programming code may includ **static code analysis** 
 such as using StyleCop (there is also SonarQube).
This provides options on what violations to report.
