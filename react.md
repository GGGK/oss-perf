React provides View components for JavaScript running on browsers
as well as native apps on Android and iOS mobile devices.

React's home page is https://facebook.github.io/react/
rendered from https://github.com/facebook/react

React Native apps downloaded in mobile app stores (Google Play, Apple, Amazon, etc.)
make use of JavaScript Core in apps:

 * http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore

React was open-sourced by Facebook, and thus its Github location:

 * https://facebook.github.io/react-native/

Alternatives to React include Google (and Microsoft's) Angular.js.
