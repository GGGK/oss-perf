## Docker images</a>
To reduce redunancy, we use
**Docker** to "spin up" images into real servers (virtualized).

Images created by others are available from dockerhub.com.
In are Virtualbox images for:

  * web UI server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.)
  * database server (MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, etc.)
  * etc.

docker machine creates daemons.

Docker maintains official images at
https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/tree/master/library
for Jenkins, etc.

JMeter and TestNG are not in among them.

Docker also provides

for anyone.
