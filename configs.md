One of the most frequent reasons for both server failure and under-utilization is 
use of configuration settings inappropriate to the workload or mismatch among various configuration settings.

Configurations in servers need to be <strong>tuned and tested</strong> to obtain the most throughput.

Test runs identify the limits of configuration settings and addition of hardware.

Examples of configurations include:

   * Maximum threads
   * Maximum virtual memory allocation
   * Maximum queue length
   * Maximum cache size
   * etc.
