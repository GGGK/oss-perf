Log4j has been the most commonly used library java programmers use to produce logs.

The format of logs created by the library has been adopted in libraries for other programming languages such as C#.

Sumo Logic has a "Log Reduce" capability

There are now two versions: Log4j and Log4j 2.

Log4j 2 can contain custom log levels in addition to the standard ones:

   * ERROR
   * INFO
   * WARNING
   * DEBUG
   * TRACE
